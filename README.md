# Analyzing-Customer-Churn-in-Tableau

This is a case study I did in DataCamp for my 'Data Analyst in Tableau' certificate. 

- Analyzing the churn rate of a fictional telecom company with an example dataset
- Creation of various calculated fields and visualizations
- I made my graphs dynamic by using filters and parameters
- Created several interactive dashboards and in the end combined them into a story
